// 17.5 The D64 disk image format

// The advantage with using the 35 track D64 format, regardless of error bytes, 
// is that it can be converted directly back to a 1541 disk by either using the 
// proper cable and software on the PC, or send it down to the C64 and writing 
// it back to a 1541. It is the best documented format since it is also native 
// to the C64, with many books explaining the disk layout and the internals of the 1541.

// First and foremost we have D64, which is basically a sector-for-sector copy
// of a 1540/1541 disk. There are several versions of these which I will cover 
// shortly. The standard D64 is a 174848 byte file comprised of 256 byte 
// sectors arranged in 35 tracks with a varying number of sectors per track 
// for a total of 683 sectors. Track counting starts at 1, not 0, and goes 
// up to 35. Sector counting starts at 0, not 1, for the first sector, 
// therefore a track with 21 sectors will go from 0 to 20.
//
// The original media (a 5.25" disk) has the tracks laid out in circles, 
// with track 1 on the very outside of the disk (closest to the sides) to track 
// 35 being on the inside of the disk (closest to the inner hub ring). 
//
// Commodore, in their infinite wisdom, varied the number of sectors per track 
// and data densities across the disk to optimize available storage, resulting in 
// the chart below. It shows the sectors/track for a standard D64. Since the 
// outside diameter of a circle is the largest (versus closer to the center), 
// the outside tracks have the largest amount of storage.
// Tracks 36-40 apply to 40- and 42-track images only.
// Tracks 41-42 apply to 42-track images only.

// The directory track should be contained totally on track 18. 
// Sectors 1-18 contain the entries and sector 0 contains the BAM 
// (Block Availability Map) and disk name/ID. Since the directory is 
// only 18 sectors large (19 less one for the BAM), and each sector can 
// contain only 8 entries (32 bytes per entry), the maximum number of 
// directory entries is 18 * 8 = 144. The first directory sector is always 
// 18/1, even though the t/s pointer at 18/0 (first two bytes) might point 
// somewhere else. It then follows the same chain structure as a normal 
// file, using a sector interleave of 3. This makes the chain links go 18/1, 
// 18/4, 18/7 etc.

// Note that you can extend the directory off of track 18, but only when reading 
// the disk or image. Attempting to write to a directory sector not on track 18 
// will cause directory corruption. Each directory sector has the following 
// layout (18/1 partial dump):

// Used to represent the number of the track (1...42)
typedef unsigned char D64Track;

// Used to represent the number of the sector (1...35) or 
// total number of sectors, as well.

// Used to respresent a 1-byte length (0...255)
typedef unsigned char D64ByteLength;

// Used to respresent a 2-byte length (0...65535)
typedef unsigned short D64WordLength;

// Each filetype has its own unique properties, but most follow one simple structure. 
// The first file sector is pointed to by the directory and follows a t/s chain, 
// until the track value reaches $00. When this happens, the value in the sector 
// link location indicates how much of the sector is used. For example, the 
// following chain indicates a file 6 sectors long, and ends when we encounter the 
// $00/$34 chain. At this point the last sector occupies from bytes $02-$34.

// Files, on a standard 1541, are stored using an interleave of 10. Assuming a starting 
// track/sector of 17/0, the chain would run 17/0, 17/10, 17/20, 17/8, 17/18, etc.

// 17.5.1 Non-Standard & Long Directories
// Most Commdore floppy disk drives use a single dedicated directory track where all
// filenames are stored. This limits the number of files stored on a disk based on
// the number of sectors on the directory track. There are some disk images that contain
// more files than would normally be allowed. This requires extending the directory off
// the default directory track by changing the last directory sector pointer to a new
// track, allocating the new sectors in the BAM, and manually placing (or moving existing)
// file entries there. The directory of an extended disk can be read and the files that
// reside there can be loaded without problems on a real drive. However, this is still a 
// very dangerous practice as writing to the extended portion of the directory will cause
// directory corruption in the non-extended part. Many of the floppy drives core ROM 
// routines ignore the track value that the directory is on and assume the default 
// directory track for operations.

// To explain: assume that the directory has been extended from track 18 to track 
// 19/6 and that the directory is full except for a few slots on 19/6. When saving 
// a new file, the drive DOS will find an empty file slot at 19/6 offset $40 and 
// correctly write the filename and a few other things into this slot. When the 
// file is done being saved the final file information will be written to 18/6 
// offset $40 instead of 19/6 causing some directory corruption to the entry at 
// 18/6. Also, the BAM entries for the sectors occupied by the new file will 
// not be saved and the new file will be left as a SPLAT (*) file.

// Attempts to validate the disk will result in those files residing off the directory
// track to not be allocated in the BAM, and could also send the drive into an endless
// loop. The default directory track is assumed for all sector reads when validating 
// so if the directory goes to 19/6, then the validate code will read 18/6 instead. 
// If 18/6 is part of the normal directory chain then the validate routine will
// loop endlessly.

// 17.5.2 BAM layout
// The layout of the BAM area (sector 18/0) is a bit more complicated...
// Note: The BAM entries for SPEED, DOLPHIN and ProLogic DOS use the same layout as 
// standard BAM entries. One of the interesting things from the BAM sector is the byte 
// at offset $02, the DOS version byte. If it is set to anything other than $41 or $00, 
// then we have what is called "soft write protection". Any attempt to write to the disk 
// will return the "DOS Version" error code 73 ,"CBM DOS V 2.6 1541". 
// The 1541 is simply telling you that it thinks the disk format version is incorrect. 
// This message will normally come up when you first turn on the 1541 and read the 
// error channel. If you write a $00 or a $41 into 1541 memory location $00FF 
// (for device 0), then you can circumvent this type of write-protection, and change the
// DOS version back to what it should be.

// The BAM entries require a bit (no pun intended) more of a breakdown. 
typedef struct _D64BAMEntry {

    // The first byte ($12) is the number of free sectors on that track.

    // The next three bytes represent the bitmap of which sectors 
    // are used/free. Since it is 3 bytes (8 bits/byte) we have 24 bits of storage. 
    // Remember that at most, each track only has 21 sectors, so there are a 
    // few unused bits.
    // These entries must be viewed in binary to make any sense. 
    // In order to make any sense from the binary notation, flip the bits around.

//    of the PC utilities do allow you to create and work with these files. 
//    This can also have error bytes attached like variant #1.

// 3. A 42 track layout, with two extra tracks of 17 sectors each. This is 
//    extremely uncommon, since real drives often have problems with accessing 
//    these tracks, software that uses them is very rare.

// 4. The Commodore 128 allowed for "auto-boot" disks. With this, t/s 1/0
